## About

It's the launch of our first NuGet packages:
* [FrApp42.System](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FrApp42.System)
* [FrApp42.Web](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FrApp42.Web)

It takes us quite a time, but there will be more packages soon ðŸ‘€. You can subscribe to our [GitHub](https://github.com/FrApp42) to be notified of future releases.

The [documentation](/docs/tools/) is ready and you can start using these packages in your C# projects.
